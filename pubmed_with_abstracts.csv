Reproducible and clinically translatable deep neural networks for cervical screening,36909463,"Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality, with approximately 90% of the 250,000 deaths per year occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Secondary prevention with cervical screening involves detecting and treating precursor lesions; however, scaling screening efforts in LMIC has been hampered by infrastructure and cost constraints. Recent work has supported the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline on digital images of the cervix to achieve an accurate and reliable diagnosis of treatable precancerous lesions. In particular, WHO guidelines emphasize visual triage of women testing positive for human papillomavirus (HPV) as the primary screen, and AI could assist in this triage task. Published AI reports have exhibited overfitting, lack of portability, and unrealistic, near-perfect performance estimates. To surmount recognized issues, we implemented a comprehensive deep-learning model selection and optimization study on a large, collated, multi-institutional dataset of 9,462 women (17,013 images). We evaluated relative portability, repeatability, and classification performance. The top performing model, when combined with HPV type, achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.89 within our study population of interest, and a limited total extreme misclassification rate of 3.4%, on held-aside test sets. Our work is among the first efforts at designing a robust, repeatable, accurate and clinically translatable deep-learning model for cervical screening."
REPRODUCIBLE AND CLINICALLY TRANSLATABLE DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS FOR CANCER SCREENING,38066031,"Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality, with approximately 90% of the 250,000 deaths per year occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).

Our model also produced reliable and consistent predictions, achieving a strong quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) of 0.86 and a minimal %2-class disagreement (% 2-Cl. D.) of 0.69%, between image pairs across women. Our work is among the first efforts at designing a robust, repeatable, accurate and clinically translatable deep-learning model for cervical screening."
A reliable and valid questionnaire was developed to measure computer vision syndrome at the workplace,38026296,"Aim:This study aimed to assess the prevalence of Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) among children and adolescents in Qatar during the period of remote learning and explore the associated factors and discuss some digital health remedies that might reduce the risk.Methods:We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study between June and August 2022 by collecting data via telephone interviews with parents of selected students utilizing the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire (CVS-Q).Results:We completed 1,546 interviews. The mean age of the students was (11 ± 2), male: female ratio was almost 1:1. About one quarter (368, 23.8%) of parents reported a previous diagnosis of visual disturbances among their children with over 88% of them wearing eyeglasses or medical contact lenses. The prevalence of CVS in our sample was about 8% (95%CI: 6.8-9.6). Mother's employment, having positive history of visual disturbances, and excess screen time were found to be significant predictors of CVS.Conclusion:Health care providers in collaboration with teachers should provide parents with evidence-based strategies to prevent or minimize the digital eye strain among students. In the landscape of remote learning, the implementation of digital remedies emerges as a proactive approach to mitigate the risk of digital eye strain."

Generative artificial intelligence performs rudimentary structural biology modeling,38293060,"Natural language-based generative artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prevalent in scientific research. Intriguingly, capabilities of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) language models beyond the scope of natural language tasks have recently been identified. Here we explored how GPT-4 might be able to perform rudimentary structural biology modeling. We prompted GPT-4 to model 3D structures for the 20 standard amino acids and an α-helical polypeptide chain, with the latter incorporating Wolfram mathematical computation. We also used GPT-4 to perform structural interaction analysis between nirmatrelvir and its target, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Geometric parameters of the generated structures typically approximated close to experimental references. However, modeling was sporadically error-prone and molecular complexity was not well tolerated. Interaction analysis further revealed the ability of GPT-4 to identify specific amino acid residues involved in ligand binding along with corresponding bond distances. Despite current limitations, we show the capacity of natural language generative AI to perform basic structural biology modeling and interaction analysis with atomic-scale accuracy."
Transformer-based biomarker prediction from colorectal cancer histology: A large-scale multicentric study,37652005,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly gaining interest in medicine, including pathological assessments for personalized medicine. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Wagner et al. demonstrate superior accuracy of transformer-based deep learning in predicting biomarker status in CRC. The work has implications for increased efficiency and accuracy in clinical diagnostics guiding treatment decisions in precision oncology."

Development of a liver disease-specific large language model chat interface using retrieval-augmented generation,37986764,"Background:Large language models (LLMs) have significant capabilities in clinical information processing tasks. Commercially available LLMs, however, are not optimized for clinical uses and are prone to generating incorrect or hallucinatory information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an enterprise architecture that allows embedding of customized data into LLMs. This approach ""specializes"" the LLMs and is thought to reduce hallucinations.Methods:We developed ""LiVersa,"" a liver disease-specific LLM, by using our institution's protected health information (PHI)-complaint text embedding and LLM platform, ""Versa."" We conducted RAG on 30 publicly available American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines and guidance documents to be incorporated into LiVersa. We evaluated LiVersa's performance by comparing its responses versus those of trainees from a previously published knowledge assessment study regarding hepatitis B (HBV) treatment and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance.Results:LiVersa answered all 10 questions correctly when forced to provide a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. Full detailed responses with justifications and rationales, however, were not completely correct for three of the questions.Discussions:In this study, we demonstrated the ability to build disease-specific and PHI-compliant LLMs using RAG. While our LLM, LiVersa, demonstrated more specificity in answering questions related to clinical hepatology - there were some knowledge deficiencies due to limitations set by the number and types of documents used for RAG. The LiVersa prototype, however, is a proof of concept for utilizing RAG to customize LLMs for clinical uses and a potential strategy to realize personalized medicine in the future."
